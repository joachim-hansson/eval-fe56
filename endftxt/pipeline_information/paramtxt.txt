TALYS paramters were selected by linearizing the TALYS model arround the reference parameters used in the TENDEL 2015 library.Taking the Jacobian of the linear model, the model sensitivity wasdetermined for the avalible data for all parameters. Only parameters which are sensitive to avalible data were kept. In the list below, sensitive paramers ar labled with LM to indicate that they were optimized using the LM algorithm. Energy-dependent paramters are written on the form *adjust(E)* where E denote the energy. Note that this notation is used in the pipeline only. In the pipeline TALYS paramters are transformed to lie on the interval 0.5-1.5 by using a logistic transofmration, whilte paramters used by the LM algoritm are allowed to take any value. In the table below, transformed paramters are given, as used in the LM algorithm. Before inputing these paramters, or samples thereof, to TALYS, they have to bee transformed back.
