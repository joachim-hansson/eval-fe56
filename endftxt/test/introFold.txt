This evaluation primarily builds upon the nuclear model TALYS and 
its associated code system. More information about the TALYS  
nuclear model and the Talys Evaluated Nuclear Data Library (TENDL) 
can be found further down in the section entiteled General 
Information, as supplied by the default ENDF file produced with 
TEFAL after having run TALYS.

In this evaluation, advanced statistical methods are used to 
optimize TALYS parameters, compensate for inconsistent data and to 
treat model deficiencies. The TALYS model is optimized using  
angle-integrated cross section data between 2-30 MeV for neutron 
induced reactions in Fe56. All data used in this evaluation were 
extracted from the EXFOR database. The EXFOR reaction codes and 
the number of data points is shown in the table below.
