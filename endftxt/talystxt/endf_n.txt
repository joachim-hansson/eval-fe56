TENDL-2012 (Talys Evaluated Nuclear Data Library)

Neutron transport library made by Talys 

Authors: A.J. Koning and D. Rochman, NRG Petten, The Netherlands

************** G E N E R A L   I N F O R M A T I O N *************

This evaluated data file is based primarily on the nuclear model 
code Talys [kon07], version 1.4 and on existing resonance 
parameter tables. It is part of a large collection of isotopic 
evaluations, all created by running Talys with either default or
adjusted input parameters. This means that the data in this 
evaluation have been tested in detail for some isotopes against 
individual experimental data, while for other isotopes it is
only as good as the global quality of Talys at the present moment.
The mutual quality of all individual evaluations is however 
consistent: The same set of nuclear models is used and, equally 
important, the same ENDF-6 formatting procedures for each isotope.
The resulting data file provides a complete representation of 
nuclear data needed for transport, damage, heating, radioactivity,
and shielding applications over the incident neutron energy range 
from 1.0E-11 to 200 MeV. 

For the resonance range we have adopted the best possible 
resonance parameters from available numerical tables or from an 
existing library.

All transport data for neutrons, charged particles, photons and 
residual nuclides are filed using a combination of MF1,2,3,4,5,6, 
12,14,15. This includes cross sections, angular distributions, 
double-differential spectra, discrete and continuum photon 
production cross sections, and residual production (activation) 
cross sections. Moreover, isomeric production data are stored in 
MF8,9,10. This evaluation can thus be used as both transport 
and activation library. The data file has been created 
automatically using the ENDF-6 format generator TEFAL.

A complete set of covariance data is included, which is stored
in MF32,33,34.

Resonance parameters (MF2/MT151): Best data from existing sets
All other data < 200 MeV        : Produced with Talys code 

*************************** T H E O R Y **************************

Talys is a computer code system for the prediction and analysis 
of nuclear reactions. Talys simulates reactions that involve 
neutrons, gamma-rays, protons, deuterons, tritons, helions and 
alpha-particles, in the 1 keV - 200 MeV energy range and for 
target nuclides of mass 12 and heavier. This is achieved by 
implementing a suite of nuclear reaction models into a single 
code system. It enables to evaluate nuclear reactions from 
the unresolved resonance region up to intermediate energies. This 
evaluation is based on a theoretical analysis that utilizes the 
optical model, compound nucleus statistical theory, fission, 
direct reactions and pre-equilibrium processes, in combination 
with databases and models for nuclear structure. The following 
output of Talys is stored in this data file:

- Total, elastic and non-elastic cross sections
- Elastic scattering angular distributions
- Inelastic cross sections to discrete states
- Inelastic scattering angular distributions to discrete states
- Exclusive channel cross sections, e.g. (n,g), (n,2n), (n,np),..
- Exclusive channel energy spectra
- Exclusive channel double-differential spectra
- Exclusive gamma production for discrete states and continuum
- Isomeric and ground state cross sections
- Residual production cross sections
- Recoil data
- Total particle cross sections, e.g. (n,xn), (n,xp),..
- Total particle energy spectra
- Total particle double-differential spectra

Here follows a short description of the used nuclear models:

##### OPTICAL MODEL

All optical model calculations are performed by ECIS-06 [ray94], 
in Talys used as a subroutine. The default optical model 
potentials (OMP) used are the local and global parameterizations 
of Koning and Delaroche [kon03]. These are phenomenological OMPs 
for neutrons and protons which in principle are valid over the 
1 keV - 200 MeV energy range, though the low energy boundary of 
validity may differ from nucleus to nucleus. For neutrons and 
protons, the used parameterization is given in Eq. (7) of 
[kon03]. Revised versions of these potentials (unpublished) are 
used in the case of deformed nuclides.
To calculate the transmission coefficients and reaction 
cross sections for deuterons, tritons, helions and alpha 
particles, we use OMPs that are directly derived from our nucleon 
potentials using Watanabe's folding approach.

##### DIRECT REACTIONS

The built-in ECIS-06 is used for DWBA or coupled-channels 
calculations for rotational or vibrational (or a combination of
these) nuclides, depending on the information present in the
nuclear structure database of Talys.
In addition, a macroscopic, phenomenological model to describe 
giant resonances in the inelastic channel is used. For each 
multipolarity an energy weighted sum rule applies and a DWBA 
calculation with ECIS-06 is performed for each giant resonance 
state. The cross section is then spread over the continuum with a 
Gaussian distribution.

##### COMPOUND NUCLEUS

For binary compound nucleus reactions we use the model of 
Moldauer, i.e. the Hauser-Feshbach model corrected for width 
fluctuations. The transmission coefficients have been generated 
with the aforementioned OMPs and the full j,l-dependence of the 
transmission coefficients in the Hauser-Feshbach model is used. 
For each nucleus that can be reached through a binary reaction, 
several discrete levels and a continuum described by level 
densities are included simultaneously as competing channels.

The compound nucleus angular distributions are calculated with 
the Blatt-Biedenharn formalism, leading to compound nucleus 
Legendre coefficients that are added to their direct 
counterparts. For multiple compound emission, i.e. emitted 
particles after the binary emission, we use the Hauser-Feshbach 
model. Again, for each residual nucleus several discrete states 
are included as well as a continuum described by level densities. 
Multiple compound emission is continued until all reaction 
channels are closed and the population distribution of all 
residual nuclides is depleted, through gamma decay, until they
end up in the ground state or in an isomer. 

For the level density, we take the Constant Temperature Model 
with level density parameters as given in [kon08]. This employs
the temperature law at low energies and a Fermi gas expression at 
high energies, and takes into account the damping of shell 
effects at high excitation energy. We have obtained the level 
density parameters from a simultaneous fit to all experimental 
discrete levels and D0 values from the RIPL library [rip09]. 

Gamma-ray transmission coefficients are generated with the 
Kopecky-Uhl generalized Lorentzian for strength functions, with 
giant dipole resonance parameters taken from the RIPL library 
[rip09], and normalized with experimental radiative widths. 

##### PRE-EQUILIBRIUM REACTIONS

For pre-equilibrium reactions, which become important for 
incident energies above about 10 MeV, we use the two-component 
exciton model [kon04], in which the neutron or proton types of 
particles and holes are followed throughout the reaction. For 
energies above 20 MeV, multiple pre-equilibrium emission up to 
any order of particle emission was included in the calculations.
A parameterization for the squared matrix element is used that is 
valid for the whole energy range of this evaluation.

For deuterons, tritons, helions and alpha-particles, an extra
contribution was added from the pick/up and knock-out reaction
model by Kalbach [kal05]. 

For photons, the model of Akkermans and Gruppelaar [akk85] was 
applied, to simulate the direct and semi-direct capture 
processes. 

The angular distribution systematics by Kalbach [kal88] were used 
to describe the angular distributions for all continuum 
particles. An isotopic distribution for photons was adopted.

##### MF1: GENERAL INFORMATION 
 
- MT451    : Descriptive data and directory
  
This text and the full directory of used MF/MT sections.

##### MF2: RESONANCE PARAMETERS

- MT151    : Resonance parameters

If present, we adopt the resonance parameters from an existing 
table or library. The choice of library is made, for each isotope 
separately, on basis of completeness, date of the evaluation and 
used representation. If not present, the potential scattering 
radius, calculated from the optical model, is written to MF2.
The default is to take the resonances from a revised version of
the Atlas of Neutron Resonances, 5th edition [mug06]. 

##### MF3: REACTION CROSS SECTIONS

All the data present in the following MT-sections have been 
calculated with Talys. If the maximal cross section in an 
excitation function over the whole energy range does not exceed 
1.e-9 b, the MT-number is not included at all. Cross sections 
lower than 1.e-20 b are assumed to have no physical meaning and 
are set to zero. We present only the most important reactions
explicitly with a separate MT-number. The minor reaction channels
are also present but they are stored in MT5 and can be
reproduced in combination with MF6. All MT numbers extend up to
the highest incident energy.
The following reaction channels/MT numbers are generally included:

- MT1      : Total cross section 

Calculated with the optical model over the whole energy range,
or partly reproduced using experimental data.

- MT2      : Elastic scattering cross section 

Obtained by subtracting the non-elastic cross section from the
total cross section. 

- MT3      : Non-elastic cross section 

Calculated with the optical model over the whole energy range.

- MT4      : Total inelastic cross section

Sum of MT=51-91.

- MT5      : (n,anything) cross section

MT5 contains the reactions which can not be stored in any other 
MT-number. As the incident energy increases, the cross section 
of MT5 increases as more reaction channels are no longer stored 
under a specific MT number. The information of MF3/MT5 can be 
combined with MF6/MT5 to obtain residual production cross 
sections particle production cross sections and 
(double-)differential cross sections.

- MT16     : (n,2n) cross section
- MT17     : (n,3n) cross section
- MT22     : (n,na) cross section
- MT28     : (n,np) cross section
- MT51-70  : (n,n') cross section for 1st-20th excited state
- MT91     : (n,n') continuum cross section
- MT102    : (n,gamma) cross section 
- MT103    : (n,p) cross section
- MT104    : (n,d) cross section
- MT105    : (n,t) cross section
- MT106    : (n,h) cross section
- MT107    : (n,a) cross section
- MT600-610: (n,p) cross section for 0th-10th excited state
- MT649    : (n,p) continuum cross section
- MT650-655: (n,d) cross section for 0th-5th excited state
- MT699    : (n,d) continuum cross section
- MT700-705: (n,t) cross section for 0th-5th excited state
- MT749    : (n,t) continuum cross section
- MT750-755: (n,h) cross section for 0th-5th excited state
- MT799    : (n,h) continuum cross section
- MT800-810: (n,a) cross section for 0th-10th excited state
- MT849    : (n,a) continuum cross section

##### MF4: ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS OF SECONDARY PARTICLES

We use MF4 for the neutron scattering angular distribution for 
discrete levels. 

- MT2      : Elastic angular distribution         

The flag LTT=3 is used to indicate a switch at some high energy,
generally 50 MeV, from a Legendre representation to a tabulated 
representation. For incident energies below this energy, the 
Legendre coefficients are given on a sufficiently precise energy 
grid. They are a sum of calculated Legendre coefficients for 
compound nucleus and shape-elastic scattering. For higher 
incident energies, relative angular distributions are tabulated 
on an angular grid. 

- MT51-70  : (n,n') angular distribution for 1st-20th state
- MT600-610: (n,p) angular distribution for 0th-10th state
- MT650-655: (n,d) angular distribution for 0th-5th state
- MT700-705: (n,t) angular distribution for 0th-5th state
- MT750-755: (n,h) angular distribution for 0th-5th state
- MT800-810: (n,a) angular distribution for 0th-10th state

##### MF6: PRODUCT ENERGY-ANGLE DISTRIBUTIONS

In MF6 we store all secondary energy, angle, and energy-angle 
distributions, as well as all residual and discrete + continuum
photon production cross sections for channels other than capture 
(MT102) and reactions to discrete levels (MT51,etc.). 
All data are generated with Talys.

- MT5      : (n,anything) yields and energy-angle distributions

MT5 contains the production yields of particles and residual 
products. It also contains the secondary energy-angle 
distributions for all particles and photons which are not
represented by explicit MT numbers. First, the yields for 
neutrons are given for the whole energy range. Next, on a 
secondary energy grid the relative emission spectra are given 
together with the parameters for the Kalbach systematics for 
angular distributions. Inelastic scattering cross sections for 
discrete states have been broadened and added to the continuum 
spectra. This procedure is repeated for protons, deuterons, 
tritons, Helium-3, alpha particles and photons. Finally, the 
residual production yields are given per final product. All these 
yields and relative distributions can be multiplied with the 
cross sections given in MF3/MT5 to get the production cross 
sections and (double-)differential cross sections.

- MT16     : (n,2n) energy-angle distr. and photon production

First, for each type of outgoing particle, the (trivial) integer 
particle yields are given. Next, on a sufficiently dense incident 
energy grid the secondary energy-angle distributions are 
specified by means of the relative emission spectra and the 
parameters for the Kalbach systematics for angular distributions. 
Next, the photon yield is tabulated as a function of incident 
energy. For each incident energy, the photon production is given 
for all discrete gamma lines present in the final nucleus. A
continuum photon distribution is added to this. We assume 
isotropy for all produced gamma rays.

For the following MT-numbers, the same procedure as for MT16 is
followed:

- MT17 : (n,3n) energy-angle distr. and photon production
- MT22 : (n,na) energy-angle distr. and photon production
- MT28 : (n,np) energy-angle distr. and photon production
- MT91 : (n,n') continuum energy-angle distr. and phot. prod.
- MT649: (n,p) continuum energy-angle distr. and photon prod.
- MT699: (n,d) continuum energy-angle distr. and photon prod.
- MT749: (n,t) continuum energy-angle distr. and photon prod.
- MT809: (n,h) continuum energy-angle distr. and photon prod.
- MT849: (n,a) continuum energy-angle distr. and photon prod.

##### MF8: RADIOACTIVE DECAY DATA

For reactions to isomers, MF8 designates where the information 
for isomeric versus ground state production can be found, i.e. 
for each MT number it points to either MF6, MF9 or MF10.

##### MF9: MULTIPLICITIES FOR PRODUCTION OF RADIOACTIVE NUCLIDES

MF9 is used for non-threshold reactions.
All data are generated with Talys. Final states with a lifetime
that exceeds 1 second are treated as isomer.

##### MF10: CROSS SECTIONS FOR PRODUCTION OF RADIOACTIVE NUCLIDES

MF10 is used for threshold reactions.
All data are generated with Talys. Final states with a lifetime
that exceeds 1 second are treated as isomer.

##### MF12: PHOTOPRODUCTION YIELD DATA

MF12 is used for the photon production for two types of reactions:
- Reactions to discrete levels (MT51, etc.) For this transition 
  probabilities are used (LO=2)
- Photons from neutron capture (MT102). Here multiplicities are
  given

##### MF14: PHOTON ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS

All photon production is considered as isotropic

##### MF15: PHOTON ENERGY SPECTRA

For capture (MT102), the photon energy spectrum is given.

##### MF32: COVARIANCES OF RESONANCE PARAMETERS

In MF32, we store the covariances of resonance parameters 
considering the resonance energy and the neutron and radiative 
widths. The uncertainties of these parameters are based on the 
Atlas of Neutron Resonances, 5th edition [mug06]. For each 
isotope, the bound level resonance parameters, scattering radius 
and uncertainties have been adjusted to match the microscopic 
uncertainties (thermal elastic and capture cross sections as well 
as the capture integral), as given in the Atlas, or as extracted
from evaluated libraries. For parameter correlation between Gn 
and Gg, no long-range correlation is considered for the time 
being. As short-range correlation (between parameters of the same 
resonance), the method described in Ref [roc08a] is used. 
Uncertainties on cross sections have been checked and are 
partially presented in Ref.[roc08b] and Ref.[roc08c]. It should 
be noted that the scattering radius can not be varied in the
existing format for MF-32, (which would underestimate the 
elastic and total cross section uncertainties between resonances) 
however we have added its uncertainty in a vacant field in the 
header of each subsection.

##### MF33: COVARIANCES OF NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS

In MF33, we store the covariances of most, but not all, reaction
channels that are given in MF3. All covariances are generated
with the TASMAN code, which generates Talys runs using a Monte
Carlo parameter method.
For each MT-number, the information consists of:
1. Covariances for MTa, Ea and MTa, Ea (variances)
2. Covariances for MTa, Ea and MTa, Eb (correlations for the
   same reaction channel between different energies)
3. Covariances for MTa, Ea and MTb, Ea (correlations between
   different reaction channels for the same energy)
4. Covariances for MTa, Ea and MTb, Eb (correlations between
   different reaction channels for different energies)
Classes 1 and 2 are covered by NI-type subsubsections with
flag LB=5, followed by an obligatory LB=8 section which contains
the cross section variances multiplied by 1.e-3 (a suggestion
adopted from S. Tagesen and used, for example, in the JEFF-3.1 
Fe-56 file). Next, classes 3 and 4 are covered by flag LB=6 to 
account for the different energy grids that two correlating 
MT-sections may have. Since the total correlation matrix is fully 
symmetric, we only need to include the correlation elements 
between different MT-numbers once, and we do that in the 
subsection with the lowest of the two MT-numbers.
We include covariance information for all the total cross 
sections, the lumped partial cross sections and the individual 
inelastic cross sections per level (MT51,...). We do not include 
covariances for MT600 and higher MT-numbers.

##### MF34: COVARIANCES OF ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS 

In MF34, we store the covariances of the elastic scattering 
angular distributions that are given in MF4/MT2. All covariances 
are generated with the TASMAN code, which generates Talys runs 
using a Monte Carlo parameter method.
The tables are restricted to MT2 and contain covariances for the 
first 6 Legendre coefficients. Boht intra- and inter-correlations 
of the various Legendre coefficients are given. As in MF33, the 
LB5 representation is used.
